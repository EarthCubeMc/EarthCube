# antideathchest: false         [true/false]    Do not allow other plugins to fiddle with dropping player heads, makes certain they drop on the ground
# dropboringplayerheads: false  [true/false]    Drop plain heads when a player dies, instead of the player's head

#                                               When true (or pre-4.2), the head is automatically converted to vanilla or skinned depending on the state of `dropvanillaheads` setting. (version 4.2+)
# nerfdeathspam: false          [true/false]    Don't drop a head when a player has died recently to the same killer (within 5 minutes and 5 player deaths). This alleviates some ability to farm heads. (version 4.3+)
#                                               If pkonly is disabled, a player dying repeatedly to any mob is also nerfed similarly under this option.
