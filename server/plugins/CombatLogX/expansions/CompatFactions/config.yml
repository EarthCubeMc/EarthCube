# How should CombatLogX prevent players from entering non-pvp areas?
# Valid Modes:
#  DISABLED - Don't do anything, just let them in
#  KNOCKBACK_PLAYER - Add some opposite velocity to the player so they are pushed backwards
#  CANCEL_EVENT - Cancel the player's move event
#  VULNERABLE - Let the player in, but remove their pvp protection
#  KILL_PLAYER - Set the player's health to 0
#  TELEPORT_TO_ENEMY - Teleport the player to their enemy if they have one, or CANCEL if they don't have one.
# Default: KNOCKBACK_PLAYER
no-entry-mode: "KNOCKBACK_PLAYER"

# This value is only used if 'no-entry-mode' is KNOCKBACK_PLAYER
# How much should the backwards velocity be multiplied by?
# Default: 1.5
knockback-strength: 1.5

# How much time (in seconds) should the plugin wait before sending another 'no-entry' message?
# Default: 30
message-cooldown: 30
