# This config allows servers to change which data is persistent and which data isn't
# For 10 years mcMMO had transient data (temporary) for a lot of things and recently in October 2020 I added the option to have things be persistent (saved to disk and permanently remembered)
# However, this is Minecraft, and Minecraft has a lot of entities, and when you start to make data persistent there is a performance cost associated with that
# Any option you turn on, is another thing your disk has to save when a chunk is being unloaded with that entity inside of it, Minecraft can quickly build up tens of thousands of entities so keep this in mind.
